# Design Rationale
## Justification for Visualization Choices

### Overview
This document provides detailed justification for each visualization technique selected in the hierarchical data analysis project for Terra Cotta Foods (TCF) expansion strategy. The visualizations are specifically designed to support Marco Antonelli's decision-making process for international expansion into Latin America and Asia, explaining the rationale behind design decisions, color choices, layout strategies, and interactive features that directly address TCF's business needs.

### Visualization Technique Selection

#### 1. Treemap (Static & Interactive)

**Rationale for Selection for TCF:**
- **Market Size Visualization:** Treemaps excel at showing market size proportions, making them ideal for Marco to quickly identify the largest potential markets for TCF's expansion
- **Purchasing Power Comparison:** Rectangle sizes naturally represent market potential, allowing Marco to compare "invest in X or Y" scenarios at a glance
- **Executive Decision Support:** Space efficiency and intuitive design enable Marco to make strategic decisions within his time constraints

**Design Decisions:**
- **Static Version (Squarify):** Used for clear, high-quality figures suitable for reports and presentations
- **Interactive Version (Plotly):** Provides drill-down capabilities and hover information for detailed exploration
- **Color Encoding:** Blue color scale for GDP per capita creates intuitive "cooler = lower, warmer = higher" association

**Technical Justification:**
```python
# Squarify for static visualization - better control over layout
squarify.plot(sizes=continent_pop['Population'], 
              label=continent_pop['Continent'],
              alpha=0.8,
              color=plt.cm.Set3.colors)

# Plotly for interactive features - hover, zoom, drill-down
px.treemap(data_clean,
           path=['Continent', 'Country'],
           values='Population',
           color='Gdp_per_capita')
```

**Why This Works for TCF:**
- **Market Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between regional markets (continents) and specific countries for TCF's expansion planning
- **Dual Business Metrics:** Size represents market size (population), color represents purchasing power (GDP per capita) - exactly what Marco needs for investment decisions
- **Scalability:** Handles 193 countries without visual clutter, allowing Marco to see both high-level regional strategy and specific country opportunities

#### 2. Dendrogram (Hierarchical Clustering)

**Rationale for Selection for TCF:**
- **Market Clustering:** Reveals hidden similarities between countries that aren't obvious from geographic proximity - crucial for TCF's supplier diversification strategy
- **Risk Assessment:** Provides quantitative basis for grouping similar markets, helping Marco understand which countries share similar economic risks
- **Strategic Grouping:** Uses established statistical methods to identify markets that can be managed with similar strategies

**Design Decisions:**
- **Ward Method:** Minimizes within-cluster variance, creating compact, well-separated clusters
- **Color Coding:** Different colors for each cluster enhance visual distinction
- **Threshold Line:** Red dashed line shows optimal clustering level for interpretation

**Technical Justification:**
```python
# Standardization ensures equal weight for different metrics
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Ward method creates compact, spherical clusters
linkage_matrix = linkage(distances, method='ward')

# Color threshold for visual cluster identification
dendro = dendrogram(linkage_matrix,
                    color_threshold=my_threshold,
                    above_threshold_color='#888888')
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Statistical Validity:** Uses proven clustering algorithms
- **Visual Clarity:** Color coding makes clusters immediately identifiable
- **Interpretability:** Threshold line provides clear clustering decision point

#### 3. Sunburst Chart (Geographic & Organizational)

**Rationale for Selection:**
- **Hierarchical Navigation:** Natural drill-down from high-level to detailed views
- **Intuitive Interface:** Circular layout mimics familiar organizational charts
- **Multi-level Display:** Shows multiple hierarchy levels simultaneously

**Design Decisions:**
- **Geographic Version:** Continent → Country hierarchy with population size and GDP color
- **Organizational Version:** Company → Department → Team hierarchy with employee distribution
- **Color Schemes:** Blues for geographic data, Viridis for organizational data

**Technical Justification:**
```python
# Geographic hierarchy with economic color encoding
px.sunburst(data_clean,
            path=['Continent', 'Country'],
            values='Population',
            color='Gdp_per_capita',
            color_continuous_scale='Blues')

# Organizational hierarchy with employee distribution
go.Sunburst(labels=org_structure['labels'],
            parents=org_structure['parents'],
            values=org_structure['values'],
            branchvalues="total")
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Natural Hierarchy:** Circular layout reflects natural hierarchical thinking
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Users can drill down to desired level of detail
- **Consistent Encoding:** Size and color maintain consistent meaning across levels

#### 4. Circular Treemap (Economic & Budget Distribution)

**Rationale for Selection:**
- **Resource Allocation:** Ideal for showing how resources are distributed across hierarchical levels
- **Flow Visualization:** Icicle layout shows resource flow from top to bottom
- **Comparative Analysis:** Easy to compare resource allocation across different categories

**Design Decisions:**
- **Economic Version:** GDP total distribution with GDP per capita color encoding
- **Budget Version:** Budget allocation with green color scale for financial data
- **Hierarchical Path:** Clear parent-child relationships in data structure

**Technical Justification:**
```python
# Economic distribution with hierarchical flow
px.icicle(data_clean,
          path=['Continent', 'Country'],
          values='Gdp_total',
          color='Gdp_per_capita',
          color_continuous_scale='Reds')

# Budget distribution with financial color scheme
px.icicle(budget_data,
          path=['parents', 'labels'],
          values='budget',
          color_continuous_scale='Greens')
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Resource Focus:** Icicle layout naturally represents resource allocation
- **Color Psychology:** Green for budget (money), red for economic data (attention-grabbing)
- **Hierarchical Flow:** Top-down layout matches organizational thinking

### Color Scheme Rationale

#### Geographic Data (Blues)
- **Primary Blue:** Represents water/ocean, natural for geographic data
- **Intensity Mapping:** Darker blue = higher GDP per capita (more prosperous)
- **Cultural Association:** Blue is universally associated with trust and stability

#### Economic Data (Reds)
- **Attention-Grabbing:** Red draws attention to important economic metrics
- **Intensity Mapping:** Darker red = higher values (more significant)
- **Warning Association:** Red can indicate areas needing attention

#### Organizational Data (Greens)
- **Growth Association:** Green represents growth and positive financial outcomes
- **Budget Context:** Traditional color for financial/monetary data
- **Calming Effect:** Green reduces stress when viewing financial information

#### Clustering Data (Multi-color)
- **Distinction:** Different colors for each cluster enhance visual separation
- **Accessibility:** High contrast colors ensure visibility for colorblind users
- **Psychological Impact:** Bright colors create positive engagement
